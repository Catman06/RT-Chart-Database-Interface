# Rogue Trader TTRPG Database Interface

Built for a Rogue Trader campaign, because I wanted a way to keep track of what warp routes have been charted by my players and keep records of the systems interacted with.
This site will allow my players to find charted routes that originate or end at any location and add newly charted ones to the database as well as adding, editing, and viewing star systems.
